# Basic Lisp Project
## What

Basic structure of a Lisp project.

* It uses asdf + quicklisp to manage dependencies.

## Setup

* Copy the project to a new directory.
* Rename the directory, .asdf file, system name in the asdf to the same name. The package names can differ.
* Create symbolic links in ~/quicklisp/local-projects/ for asdf and quicklisp to find your project by name.
  * ln -s REALDIR projname

## Run it

Make sure that quicklisp is loaded in your lisp environment. If not do this step explicitly (eg. Lispworks personal edition).

    (load "~/quicklisp/setup")

Then load the system and execute some code

​    (ql:quickload :tmplt-basic-lisp )
​    (basic-lisp:run)

## Unit tests

    (asdf:test-system :tmplt-basic-lisp)
    or
    (asdf:operate 'asdf:test-op :tmplt-basic-lisp)

## Structure Notes

* The asdf file contains two system definitions, a main definition and a test definition. The test definition is hierarchically structured by using a slash / in the name. In this way asdf can find the definition without needing a directory or .asdf file with the same name.
* src/ contains the sources of the main package.
* t/ contains the sources for the unit tests.
